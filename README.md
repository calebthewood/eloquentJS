# eloquentJS

## A repo for projects and algorithms inspired by playing around with [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)


## Chapter Summaries
I completed chapters 1-4 before starting this repository. My notes and work are lost to the confines of an old laptop, but I may revisit the next time I brush up on the fundamentals.

### Part 1: Language
1. Values, Types, and Operators
- Review on fundamental concepts: Booleans, Logical Operators, Unary Operators, short-circuiting, etc.
2. Program Structure
- Detailed reading on Expressions, Statements, Bindings, Control Flow, Conditional Execution, Loops, Naming, Comments, etc.
3. Functions
- Defining, Binding, Scope, Functions as Values, Arrow Fns, Call Stack, Optional Arguments, Closures, Recursion, Constructors, and Side Effects.
4. Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
- All about how to work with a data set. In this chapter I manipulated arrays and objects to analyze a Squirrel's diary, and determine what foods caused him to transform into a wherewolf. Covered topics like the rest operator, Math object, Destructuring, and JSON.
5. Higher-order Functions
- In this chapter I worked with unicode library to do some interesting things with strings. Covered topics like filtering, transforming, and reducing arrays, composability, character codes, and basic statistics.
6. The Secret Life of Objects
- Covered the basics on Javascript's Prototypal Inheritance, Classes, Derived Properties, Maps, Polymorphism, Symbols, Iterators, Getters, Setters, and Statics, and Instances
7. Project: A Robot
- My first time traversing a graph! This was one of the big 'Aha!' moments for me in my programming journey. In this chapter I built different graph traversal algorithms to power a robotic mailman for a small town.  Topics including Persisting Data, Pathfinding, and Animation.
8. Bugs and Errors
- Covers concepts and best practices for things like Strict Mode, Type Errors, Testing, Debugging, Error Propagation, Exceptions, Try-Catch Blocks, Assertions, and Error Handling.
9. Regular Expressions
- I had been avoiding RegEx for a full year by the time I hit this chapter, but I actually had a lot of fun learning how to construct different RegEx's myself. Learned about Matches, Groups, the Date class, mechanics of Matching, Backtracking, Replacing, Greed, Dynamic RegEx's, File Parsing, and various JS methods.
10. Modules
- In this chapter I learned about ES6 modules, npm Packages, CommonJS modules, Building, Bundling, and Dependencies.
11. Asynchronous Programming
-
12. Project: A Programming Language
### Part 2: Browser
13. JavaScript and the Browser
14. The Document Object Model
15. Handling Events
16. Project: A Platform Game
17. Drawing on Canvas
18. HTTP and Forms
19. Project: A Pixel Art Editor
### Part 3: Node
20. Node.js
21. Project: Skill-Sharing Website
