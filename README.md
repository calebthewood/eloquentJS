# eloquentJS

## A repo for projects and algorithms inspired by playing around with [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)


## Chapter Summaries
I completed chapters 1-4 before starting this repository. My notes and work are lost to the confines of an old laptop, but I may revisit the next time I brush up on the fundamentals.

### Part 1: Language
1. Values, Types, and Operators
- Review on fundamental concepts: Booleans, Logical Operators, Unary Operators, short-circuiting, etc.
2. Program Structure
- Detailed reading on Expressions, Statements, Bindings, Control Flow, Conditional Execution, Loops, Naming, Comments, etc.
3. Functions
- Defining, Binding, Scope, Functions as Values, Arrow Fns, Call Stack, Optional Arguments, Closures, Recursion, Constructors, and Side Effects.
4. Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
- All about how to work with a data set. In this chapter I manipulated arrays and objects to analyze a Squirrel's diary, and determine what foods caused him to transform into a wherewolf. Covered topics like the rest operator, Math object, Destructuring, and JSON.
